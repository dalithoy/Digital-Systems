### Tips
- Follow the classes; the topics are covered quite slowly (atleast at the time of these files).
- Solve questions.
- For the last few lab assignments, it may be helpful to use LaTeX for your reports. (especially for VHDL code, using the 'minted' package. This makes the report look more systematic, and may fetch more marks!
